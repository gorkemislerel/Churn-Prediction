First, I started by using the Telco Customer Churn dataset that I got from Kaggle. This dataset is also among the IBM Sample Datasets.

Then, when I examined the dataset, what caught my eye was that there were no null values. This made it a little easier for me.

But then the difficult process started, and I built models by doing the necessary data preprocessing. I used SMOTE, a technique used to eliminate data imbalance. At first, I used Random Forests, but since I believed it would be faster, I decided to use XGBoost. I progressed with XGBoost and received user inputs.

Then, thanks to the help I received from the internet, I managed to create an interface. I went through a very difficult process to convert the file to .exe format. After 2 days of long efforts, I created it as .exe. However, due to the problems caused by XGBoost, I used Random Forests again. However, since it slowed down many computers and filled the memory, I finally used the Decision Tree model and finished it.
